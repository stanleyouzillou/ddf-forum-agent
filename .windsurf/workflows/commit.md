Agent steps

Validate branch is up-to-date with base (git fetch + git rebase origin/main or create merge commit as per policy) â€” prefer rebase unless policy forbids.

Run test_fast_cmd & e2e_cmd (or read last run); if failures present, abort and post logs.

Create PR via gh pr create or GitHub API including Gherkin contract, list of commits, test badges, artifacts links.

Add labels: needs-review, feature/<feature_name>, assign reviewers per CODEOWNERS.

Optional: set draft vs ready state depending on tests_green.

Return PR URL and CI job URL.
